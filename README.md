## Objectives:

Analyze and summarize sales data to derive actionable insights.
Identify top-performing and underperforming pizzas by revenue, orders, and quantity.
Track daily and monthly sales trends to understand seasonality.
Represent findings visually for easy interpretation and decision-making.


## Tools & Technologies:

- PostgreSQL: For importing data and performing SQL queries.
- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create calculated fields and derive insights.
- Excel: For data preparation and preprocessing.


## Methodology:

### Data Preparation:

Created dummy data representing income, expenses, savings, and investments.
Imported the data into Power BI for analysis.


### Data Import & Preparation:

Loaded raw data into PostgreSQL for structured querying.

Used SQL to clean and filter data for analysis
